GGA
---
Time, position and fix type data. 

GSA
--- 
GNSS receiver operating mode, active satellites used in the position solution and DOP values. 

GSV
--- 
The number of GPS satellites in view satellite ID numbers, elevation, azimuth, and SNR values. 

RMC
--- 
Time, date, position, course and speed data. The recommended minimum navigation information. 

VTG
--- 
Course and speed information relative to the ground.

Log file viewer only parses 
 GGA - Time, position and fix type data - $GPGGA/$GNGGA
 RMC - Time, date, position, course and speed data. The recommended minimum navigation information. - $GPRMC/$GNRMC
 VTG - Course and speed information relative to the ground - $GPVTG/$GNVTG
 
from the standpoint of the log file viewer, GGA and RMC data are redundant - only extra data supplied by GGA is the satellites in use count
GSV just takes up space - it's details on the satellites used that is completely ignored and there are usually 2-3 sentences worth of data... 

SET_NMEA_OUTPUT command
 
Data Field:
There are totally 19 data fields that present output frequencies for the 19 supported
NMEA sentences individually.
